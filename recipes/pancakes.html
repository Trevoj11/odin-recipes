    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Light, airy, and stacked high, these fluffy pancakes are topped with fresh strawberries, blueberries, and a generous drizzle of maple syrupâ€”perfect for a cozy, delicious breakfast.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>Butter or oil for cooking</li>
        <li>Maple syrup and fresh fruit for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, mix the milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
        <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir gently until just combined. Do not overmix; a few lumps are okay.</li>
        <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease with butter or oil.</li>
        <li>Pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Flip the pancakes and cook for another 1-2 minutes until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Repeat with remaining batter, adjusting heat as necessary to prevent burning.</li>
        <li>Serve warm with maple syrup and fresh fruit on top.</li>
    </ol>
